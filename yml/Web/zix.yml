Usage:
  - Steps: Attempt to locate the zix secure messaging portal for the organization and check to see if you have the ability to register an account. Register an account with a custom email that looks like it could actually belong to an employee. Zip any files you want to exfiltrate from the workstation. Compose a new message, and address it to an employee that doesnt actually exist in the system. You can now retrieve the files on a different device by logging in and viewing the sent mail tab.
