  - Category: Data Exfiltration
    Steps to replicate: Attempt to locate the zix secure messaging portal for the organization and check to see if you have the ability to register an account. Register an account with a custom email that looks like it could actually belong to an employee. Zip any files you want to exfiltrate from the workstation. Compose a new message, and address it to an employee that doesnt actually exist in the system. You can now retrieve the files on a different device by logging in and viewing the sent mail tab.
    Usecase: Exfiltrating data in heavily monitored environments
    Privileges: User
    Limitations: Need to be able to register an account or gain access to one. Can only exfiltrate a specified amount of data per message.

  - Category: Phishing
    Steps to replicate: Register a zix secure messaging account using multiple employee email addresses. Save all of the emails and passwords registered. If an employee clicks the approve button, youll now have their newly registered account to use for whitelisted phishing. 
    Usecase: Whitelisted phishing since the email will come from Zix, which is trusted by the organization.
    Privileges: User interaction
    Limitations: An employee must click the account approval button. In addition, organizations can require an account creation code instead of an approval button.
