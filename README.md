# Living off the Land Applications
We are back. Don't submit a new template without reading the contribution guide, as some of our efforts have changed.

LOLAPPS is a compendium of applications that can be used to carry out day-to-day exploitation.

Kind of like the cousin of LOLBAS and GTFObins. Sometimes you might struggle to common binaries to exploit
and LOLAPPS is meant to be a supplementary resource for identifying native functionality in applications
that can be used to the hacker's advantage, both third-party and from within.

Applications that you have to install can be included too, but must be indicated within the "Permissions" field for templating purposes. 

# Mission

To document the techniques being used in the wild, and give red teamers some additional tools.
